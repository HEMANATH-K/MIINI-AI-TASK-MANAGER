# MINI-AI-TASK-MANAGER
Overview of the Project:
The modern MIINI AI Task Manager web application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently by using a clean and intuitive interface. With the app, one is able to create, read, update, and organize tasks with ease, thereby making task management simple and effective.

Features:

Add, view, and update tasks in real time.

Searching & filtering tasks easily.

Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

AI-powered task management suggestions.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

FastAPI (Python) - backed

Database: SQLAlchemy with SQLite

API Integration: Axios for HTTP requests, React Router for navigation

Implementation Details:

The backend is implemented by using FastAPI, which gives the RESTful APIs for performing operations on tasks. Database structure and operations are managed by SQLAlchemy. The frontend is done with React.js, getting dynamic forms and views for tasks. Axios connects the frontend with the backend to perform CRUD operations seamlessly. Purpose: It does prove that I can create a full-stack application, incorporate a React frontend into a Python FastAPI backend, and design an interface suitable for everyday use. So, all in all, this is a modern web development project that involves API integration and database management.
